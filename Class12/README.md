## In-class Question

1) Create a class called Book that stores information for each book in a library. 
The class should contain the following information:
* Title of the book
* Author
* Number of copies of the book
* Number of lent copies.
The class will contain the following methods:
* Default constructor.
* Constructor with parameters to store each of the attributes.
* Method Loan() that increases the lent copies of the book each time a loan is made.
  * No books may be borrowed if no copies are available to lend. 
  * Returns true if the operation was successful and false otherwise. 
 * Method Return() that decrements the corresponding attribute when a book is returned.
   * No books can be returned that have not been lent out. 
   * Returns true if the operation was successful and false otherwise.
   * ToString() method to display data from books in the following format:
     * `<Title>, by <Author>. <Number lent> copies lent out from <Number of copies> total`.
 * Write a program to test the operation of the Book class. This program will have a control loop that will do the following:
  * Ask the user to enter an option
     * 1 - Quit
     * 2 - Create a book
     * 3 - Take out a book
     * 4 - Return a book
  * The program will continue to loop until the user enters 1 to quit the application.
  * The program will allow the user to enter up to 10 books.
  * If the user tries to loan a book or return a book and is unsuccessful, the program will display an error message that the book can't be loaned or returned.
