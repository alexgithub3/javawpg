## Homework

For your final project, we are going to start designing and building classes that your application will need. For now, we are going to focus specifically on the information that your application will need to **store**, rather than on functionality.

* For each of your proposed use cases/features, write out a list of the data that you will need for those features.
  * Be very specific. If your application needs to store information on products, exactly what information is that? The product's name? Price? Description? What data type are all these attributes?
* Group your information classes that represent the data that your project will need to store.
  * What attributes will those classes need to contain?
  * What data types are those attributes?
  * Which attributes are other classes or collections of data?
* What is the relationship between different pieces of data in your application?
  * Do some classes contain instances of others?
  * Do you have any base classes that different classes should inherit from?

Once you've written out this information, start writing your classes in java.

* Create all the classes needed for the information you want to store.
* Add attributes to your classes for the exact details you want stored.
* Add relationships between your classes as your data relates to each other.
  * For example, if you are storing customer appointments, does the customer class contain a list of appointment classes? Or maybe your appointment class contains an associated customer? This is up to you to decide.

Once you are finished, we will be adding what you have so far to our github repositories. This will be covered in a future lecture.
