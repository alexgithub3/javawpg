## Homework

Use the topics we have learned on web development to start creating the interface for your project. For now, don't worry about where the data is coming from and how to get it into your website. You can hard code the data in there to get the look and feel, and we will be adding in the ability to get content dynamically later on.

To create a sample JSP application, use the following steps.
* Create a new maven project in your IDE of choice.
  * Add in the following files to your application:
    * [\\pom.xml](pom.xml)
    * [\\src\\main\\java\\webbapp\\LoginServlet.java](LoginServlet.java)
    * [\\src\\main\\webapp\\WEB-INF\\web.xml](web.xml)
    * [\\src\\main\\webapp\\styles\\main.css](main.css)
* Decide what pages your website needs for the various features. Start with a small, core set of features first.
* Create html files for each of your pages.
* Design the pages of your website using html tags.
* Style your website using css files.
  * You can also use bootstrap or any other framework you prefer.
